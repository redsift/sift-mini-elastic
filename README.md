This Sift indexes every day the first 1000 entries from a dense [CSV](http://downloads.majestic.com/majestic_million.csv), published by Majestic, of the top million of the best indexed sites and then exposes an endpoint for querying it. This is a simple sift showcasing the capabilities of our platform to accompany our [Rebuilding full text search in Go for our server-less environment](https://medium.com/redsift-outbox/rebuilding-full-text-search-in-go-for-our-server-less-environment-f3fa6cb28b1) blog post.


## Social coding
We like pull requests. If you want to fork it, add your own functionality, run it on your own data  and share it with the world, that's also cool.
